# Description

## Motivation

Free your self from paid services and use your own resources to develope or serve self hosted services.
You can setup on VM's or local computer or change your cloud provider with low effort.

When I start a development process I always think about longterm decisions that add values like:

- technical documentation
- reduce costs
- save time
- increase robustness
- increase resiliance of the whole project
- cross platform compatibility
- easy configuration (white labeling)

And I wonder what are the most valuble **online / offline** services for my team and me?

**The most important compartments are:**

- Git platform (VCS) code repositories
- Networking (VPN, DNS, Intranet, etc.)
- Operating Systems (Linux,Windows,Mac,Android,etc.)
- Container Platforms (Docker, Kubernetes, Proxmox etc.)
- Container registry (e.g. DockerHub)
- Package Manager & Source Code Registries (apt,apk,pipy,nodejs,yarn)
- Communication and Collaboration Services (E-Mail, Messanger, Notifier, O-Auth, Gitlab, Bitbucket,S3, etc.)
- Virtual Machine Images (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Alpine etc. )
- Servers (any, general purpose, runner and so on)
- Databases (e.g. Backend connection, API etc.)
- Frameworks & Coding Languages (kubernetes,python,helm,nodejs,django etc.)

## Problems

As a software developer it is hard not to work with cloud services like AWS, Azure, GCP or other "Big Players".
Cloud providers are the new "Gate Keepers" and they make the rules, prices and standards.
Centralized Datacenters all over the world

- closed source code and data
- cooperation and interaction of stakeholders

## Purpose

Local development with minimal or no integration of paid services. Freedom of choice to switch anytime to paid services. 

## Scope

For developers, system architects, entrepreneurs, companies, organizations and every one who wants to self host the most important software compartments.

## Stakeholders

- government
- society
- companies, organizations
- developers

## Developer Background

- The need to have full controll over the software project
- I do not want to feed the "Big Players"
- I want to democratise software development
- I need local setups to work offline
-  

## Similar Projects

You can use these technologies to achieve the same result but different scopes and compartments. For instance some use VM's others use containerd. But each needs its own workflow and has individual boundries.
